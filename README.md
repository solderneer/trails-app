Students these days, increasinly rely on technology for learning. Technology augments learning in an intuitive way that appeals to the
younger generation. trails-app is an effort to bring that concept to educational fieldtrips. Aiming to be a combination of guided museum
tours, Pokemon GO and an educational information/quiz app, trails-app can make educational fieldtrips a much more engaging and fun experience. This project was intended for the MOE Buildathon 2017, Singapore.
